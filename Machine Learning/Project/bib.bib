   abstract = {With the rise of big data analytics, learning analytics has become a major trend for improving the quality of education. Learning analytics is a methodology for helping students to succeed in the classroom; the principle is to predict student’s academic performance at an early stage and thus provide them with timely assistance. Accordingly, this study used multiple linear regression (MLR), a popular method of predicting students’ academic performance, to establish a prediction model. Moreover, we combined MLR with principal component analysis (PCA) to improve the predictive accuracy of the model. TraditionalMLR has certain drawbacks; specifically, the coefficient of determination (R2) and mean square error (MSE) measures and the quantile-quantile plot (Q-Q plot) technique cannot evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of MLR. Therefore, we propose predictive MSE (pMSE) and predictive mean absolute percentage correction (pMAPC) measures for determining the predictive performance and accuracy of the regression model, respectively. Analysis results revealed that the proposed model for predicting students’ academic performance could obtain optimal pMSE and pMAPC values by using six components obtained from PCA.},

   abstract = {Students learning performance is one of the core components for assessing any educational systems. Students performance is very crucial in tackling issues of learning process and one of the important matters to measure learning outcomes. The ability to use data knowledge to improve education systems has led to the development of the field of research known as educational data mining (EDM). EDM is the creation of techniques to investigate data gathered from educational settings, allowing for a more thorough and accurate understanding of students and the improvement of educational outcomes for them. The use of machine learning (ML) technology has increased significantly in recent years. Researchers and teachers can use the measurements of success, failure, dropout, and more provided by the discipline of data mining in education to predict and simulate education processes. Therefore, this work presents an analysis of students performance using data mining methods. The paper presents both clustering and classification techniques to identify the impact of students performance at early stage with on the GPA. For the clustering technique, the paper uses dimensionality reduction mechanism by T-SNE algorithm with various factors at early stage such as admission scores and first level courses, academic achievement tests (AAT) and general aptitude tests (GAT) in order to explore the relationship between these factors and GPA's. For the classification technique, the paper presents experiments on different machine learning models on predicting student performance at early stages using different features including courses' grades and admission tests' scores. We use different assessment metrics to evaluate the quality of the models. The results suggest that educational systems can mitigate the risks of students failures at the early stages.},

   abstract = {As a new and efficient ensemble learning algorithm, XGBoost has been widely applied for its multitudinous advantages, but its classification effect in the case of data imbalance is often not ideal. Aiming at this problem, an attempt was made to optimize the regularization term of XGBoost, and a classification algorithm based on mixed sampling and ensemble learning is proposed. The main idea is to combine SVM-SMOTE over-sampling and EasyEnsemble under-sampling technologies for data processing, and then obtain the final model based on XGBoost by training and ensemble. At the same time, the optimal parameters are automatically searched and adjusted through the Bayesian optimization algorithm to realize classification prediction. In the experimental stage, the G-mean and area under the curve (AUC) values are used as evaluation indicators to compare and analyze the classification performance of different sampling methods and algorithm models. The experimental results on the public data set also verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},
